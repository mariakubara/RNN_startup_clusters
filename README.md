# RNN_startup_clusters

Repository containing code and datasets for the paper on spatio-temporal patterns of startup localisation in Warsaw, Poland. Code includes the structure and parameter tuning for the RNN model, which enables to predict future startup clusters in the intra-urban grid locations.

Article was published in the Annals of Regional Science, and is available in Open Access.
